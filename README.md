# pythonflasksql
A simple implementation of a CRUD SQL server accessed through Flask functions

REQUIREMENTS:

The .py files must be run with python 3.0 or greater.
SQLite3 and Flask must be installed in the environment you're running app.py in

BEFORE RUNNING APP.PY:

1. Put all .html files into a folder titled "templates" which is in the same directory as app.py

2. Run setup.py to create the database used by app.py

Now you can run app.py with the command python app.py! By visting your localhost port, you can check out the website, which is a simple implementation of a restaurant review database. For more on Flask, or to try this yourself, check out these links:
